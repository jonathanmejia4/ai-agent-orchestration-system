## Signals Generated

The following signal files were created:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LogBook/issue-fixing/signals/E.status` | Lane E progress updates |
| `LogBook/issue-fixing/signals/E.done` | Lane E completion signal |
| `LogBook/issue-fixing/signals/M.status` | Lane M progress updates |
| `LogBook/issue-fixing/signals/M.done` | Lane M completion signal |

## Key Demonstration Points

1. **File-based signaling** - No agent transcript parsing required
2. **Parallel-ready** - Each lane worker operates independently
3. **Minimal context** - Orchestrator only reads small status files
4. **Idempotent** - Can re-run safely after cleanup
