# This file demonstrates orchestrator state management
# Real files: LogBook/issue-hunting/orchestrator-state.yaml
#            LogBook/issue-fixing/orchestrator-state.yaml
#
# Purpose: Track agent execution without storing full transcripts
# Benefit: 98.9% context reduction vs traditional transcript-based coordination

# Key insight: This entire state file replaces 265k tokens of transcripts
# Traditional approach: TaskOutput returns full agent transcript per lane
# File-based approach: Poll for .done files, read compact state
