               FILE-SIGNAL ORCHESTRATION DEMO               
============================================================

Demonstrating file-based agent coordination
NO AI API calls - pure orchestration pattern

[Step 1] Cleaning old signals...
  ✓ Signal directory cleaned
[Step 2] Reading issue catalog...
  → Lane E: 3 open issues
  → Lane M: 2 open issues
[Step 3] Spawning lane workers in PARALLEL...
  → In production: dozens of parallel agents via Task tool
  → In demo: Threaded simulation with same signal behavior
  → Starting Lane E worker...
  → Starting Lane M worker...
[Step 4] Polling for completion signals...
  Polling: E:○ | M:○ (0/2 done)
  Polling: E:✓ | M:✓ (2/2 done)
  ✓ All lanes completed!
[Step 5] Generating report...
  ✓ Report: examples/output/sample_run_report.md
  ✓ Signals copied to examples/output/signals/

                       DEMO COMPLETE                        
============================================================

  Lanes:        2
  Issues fixed: 5
  Signals:      LogBook/issue-fixing/signals/
  Report:       examples/output/sample_run_report.md

This demonstrates the file-signal orchestration pattern.
Lane workers ran in PARALLEL threads (simulating real agent behavior).
Real system uses Claude agents with this same signaling approach.
